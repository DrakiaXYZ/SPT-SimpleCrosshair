## About Mod

Better than a monitor crosshair! For the non-purist among us.

![it's a crosshair](Screenshots/crosshair.png)

## Configuration

You can adjust the crosshair image by dropping a PNG image named `custom_crosshair.png` inside of the `<spt-folder>\BepInEx\SimpleCrosshair\` folder. It will load that image instead of the default one.

- **Crosshair Color**: Adjust the color and opacity of the crosshair
- **Crosshair Size**: Adjust the size of the crosshair. Image will fit into the square bounds.
- **Crosshair Offset**: Adjust the offset of the crosshair outside of the exact middle. Good for custom crosshairs where the middle of the image is not the aim point.

## Installation

[Releases are here](https://github.com/mpstark/SPT-SimpleCrosshair/releases). Open zip file and drag `BepInEx` folder into root of your SPT-AKI install.
