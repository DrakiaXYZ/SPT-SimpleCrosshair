## About Mod

A mostly-static image-based crosshair with such features as: somewhat-intelligent hiding and... that's about it! For all the non-purists among us.

Hey, it's better than a monitor crosshair or an overlay one!

*With optional (turned off by default) dynamic positioning!*

## Configuration

You can adjust the crosshair image by dropping a PNG image named `custom_crosshair.png` inside of the `<spt-folder>\BepInEx\SimpleCrosshair\` folder. It will load that image instead of the default one.

- **Crosshair Color**: Adjust the color and opacity of the crosshair
- **Crosshair Size**: Adjust the size of the crosshair. Image will fit into the square bounds.
- **Crosshair Offset**: Adjust the offset of the crosshair outside of the exact middle. Good for custom crosshairs where the middle of the image is not the aim point.
- **Crosshair Fade Time**: Adjust the fade in/out time on show/hide
- **Enable Dynamic Crosshair Position**: Instead of just being a static image in the direct middle, dynamically reposition with weapon facing
